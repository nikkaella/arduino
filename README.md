#Arduino

This is my introduction to arduino. I never got to try it out in university, so I'm starting now!

I'm following [this class](https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-programming-and-hardware-fundamentals-with-hackster/).

This repository will exist some of my projects. All projects have creative freedom.
